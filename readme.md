# Project Title

Night Writer

## Description

In this project weâ€™ll implement systems for generating Braille-like text from English characters and the reverse.

The general pattern is that we will run the program, providing an existing file for input, and the name of a nonexistent file for output, and the program will provide us with a confirmation:

This will all be run from the command line.

## Areas of Focus

- Practice breaking a program into logical components
- Testing components in isolation and in combination
- Applying Enumerable techniques in a real context
- Reading text from and writing text to files


## Challenges

1. Writing and reading to a .txt file
2. Working with and converting to/from strings, arrays, multidimensional arrays
3. Formatting the output, to match braille convention(keeping letters together)
4. Limited time to complete project
5. Fully solo project

### Executing program

Program is run from your command line
```
ruby lib/night_writer message.txt braille.txt
```

```
ruby lib/night_reader message.txt braille.txt
```
